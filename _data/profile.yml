    Hi! I am a final-year PhD student in CS Department at ucsb. I'm incredibly lucky to be advised by <a href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~sra/" target="_blank">Prof. Misha Sra</a>, whose support has been invaluable in my research journey.
    My research explores how large language and multimodal models can reason, collaborate, and adapt safely in complex environments.
    I work at the intersection of <strong>agentic AI</strong>, <strong>trust and interpretability</strong>, and <strong>data infrastructure</strong> for reasoning models, aiming to make intelligent systems more transparent, efficient, and reliable.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, I was a Student Researcher at <strong>Google</strong>, where I worked on agentic system and reinforcement learning for LLMs.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research focuses on:<br/>
    1. <strong>Agentic & Collaborative LLMs</strong>: modeling coordination, planning, and reasoning among intelligent agents.<br/>
    2. <strong>Transparent and Trustworthy AI </strong>: making model reasoning processes interpretable and auditable.<br/>
    3. <strong>Data-Centric AI</strong>: designing human-aligned datasets for post-training and evaluation.<br/>
    4. <strong>Human-AI Co-Reasoning</strong>: enabling safe and adaptive interaction in scientific, creative, and high-stakes settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am open to collaborations and always excited to chat about research ideas. Please feel free to reach out to me at <code>zichen_chen [at] ucsb.edu</code>.

    I received my Master in Computer Science (Research) from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore. I was so lucky to work with <a href="https://sites.google.com/smu.edu.sg/ahtan/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Prof. Tan Ah-Hwee</a>, <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/sinnopan/" target="_blank">Prof. Sinno Jialin Pan</a>, and <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/" target="_blank">Prof. Han Yu</a>. My previous research includes <strong>reinforcement learning, federated learning, and transfer learning</strong>.

  entrepreneurship_community: >-
    Beyond academia, I was a co-founder of <strong>DAOlivia</strong>, a female club in the bay area that supports female communities and female-founded brands. I am currently running a channel exploring the journey from academic research to startup creation (subscribe <a href="https://zcchen.substack.com/" target="_blank">here</a> or <a href="https://x.com/my_cat_can_code" target="_blank">X</a>). I am especially passionate about encouraging women to take a seat at the table, helping to create more spaces for female voices and perspectives in tech and entrepreneurship. If you're interested in being a guest or have any ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out!
