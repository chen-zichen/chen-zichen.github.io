Hi! I am a forth-year PhD student in CS Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara, working at the intersection of `Explainable AI`, `Trust`, `Human-centered AI`, `Reinforcement Learning` and `Federated Learning`. I'm incredibly lucky to be advised by [Prof. Misha Sra](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~sra/), whose support has been invaluable in my research journey.

My research focuses on:
1. **Making LLM/MLLM Decisions Transparent**
2. **Grounding Explanations in Real Model's 'Thinking'**
3. **Connecting MLLM with the Physical World**
4. **Building Human Trust with AI in High-Stakes Scenarios**

I am open to collaborations and always excited to chat about research ideas. Please feel free to reach out to me at `zichen_chen [at] ucsb.edu`.


I'm honored to have received the **Innovation Award** from `AAAI` (2023). I was also a recipient of the UCSB CS Summer Fellowship, `IJCAI` Grant, `AAAI` Student Scholarship and UCSB CS Academic Excellence Fellowship. 
Beyond academia, I am a co-founder of `DAOlivia`, a female club in the bay area that supports female communities and female-founded brands.

I was a research associate at Joint NTU-WeBank Research Centre on Fintech, Singapore before. I was so lucky to work with [Prof. Tan Ah-Hwee](https://sites.google.com/smu.edu.sg/ahtan/home?authuser=0), [Prof. Sinno Jialin Pan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/sinnopan/), and [Prof. Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/). My previous research inlcudes `reinforcement learning`, recommender system, and transfer learning.

I am currently running a podcast exploring the journey from academic research to startup creation (and may even grow into a community) (subscribe [here](https://zcchen.substack.com/) or [X](https://x.com/my_cat_can_code)). I am especially passionate about encouraging women to take a seat at the table, helping to create more spaces for female voices and perspectives in tech and entrepreneurship. If you're interested in being a guest or have any ideas, please don't hesitate to reach out!
