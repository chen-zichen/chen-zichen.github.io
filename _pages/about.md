Hi! I am a third-year PhD student in CS Department at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I am interested in `Explainable AI`, `Trustworthy AI`, `Human-centered AI`, and `Federated Learning`. [Prof. Misha Sra](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~sra/) is my fantastic advisor.  

I'm honored to have received the `**Innovation Award**` from `AAAI`. I was also a recipient of the UCSB CS Summer Fellowship, `IJCAI` Travel Award, `AAAI` Student Scholarship and UCSB CS Academic Excellence Fellowship. 
Beyond academia, I am a co-founder of `DAOlivia`, a female club in the bay area that supports female communities and female-founded brands.

I was a research associate at Joint NTU-WeBank Research Centre on Fintech, Singapore before. I was so lucky to work with [Prof. Tan Ah-Hwee](https://sites.google.com/smu.edu.sg/ahtan/home?authuser=0), [Prof. Sinno Jialin Pan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/sinnopan/), and [Prof. Han Yu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/han.yu/). My previous research inlcudes `reinforcement learning`, recommender system, and transfer learning.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
